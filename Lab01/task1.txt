## Task 1: Task 1: Let X1, . . . , X10 be 10 independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, each having a standard normal distribution.

# Exact Numeric Aproach in R
# probability that a random variable will fall in interval [-1.96, 1.96]

P_in <- pnorm(1.96) - pnorm(-1.96)

# Probability of success, that one of the X's will not fall into the interval [-1.96, 1.96]
P_out <- 1 - P_in

# Bullet point solutions in order

# At least 1 X will not fall in interval (at least one success)
pbinom(9, 10, P_in)

# Exactly one Xi's will not fall in interval
dbinom(1, 10, P_out)

# Exactly two Xi's will not fall in interval
dbinom(2, 10, P_out)



# confirm cumulative probabilities add up
cum <- 0
for (i in 1:10){
  cum <- cum + dbinom(i, 10, P_out)
}
if (all.equal(cum, pbinom(9, 10, P_in))==TRUE) {
  print("Looks correct (finger's crossed!)")
}
